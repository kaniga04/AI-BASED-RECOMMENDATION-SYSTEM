DESCRIPTION: This project showcases how to build a Recommendation System in Java using Apache Mahout, a powerful machine-learning library. The system is designed to suggest products or content to users based on their preferences, leveraging collaborative filtering or content-based filtering techniques.

The recommendation system analyzes user interactions (e.g., ratings, purchases, or views) to predict and suggest items they are likely to engage with, enhancing personalization and user experience.
